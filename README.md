== README

Overview: This is an app that allows users to track their walking/running progress throughout their life, and give them interesting facts about how far they've gone to keep them  motivated to do so. The overarching metric shows them how far they've gone to the moon based on their entire walking/running history.

Ruby version: 4.

Database creation: Three tables - User, Sessions and facts. Sadly, the facts haven't been incorporated into the first version of this app, so only Sessions and Users are required. 

Regrets:
